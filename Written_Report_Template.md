# Campaign Outcomes

## Overview of Project
How different campaigns fared in realtion to their launch dates and their funding dates.

### Purpose
Visualize campagin outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
I did not have any challenges but I could see how the conversion of data into charts could be confusing. I could also see how getting the right info
into the pivot tables is absolute as you will not create the correct table.

Spring is what hot time as that is when the most successful launch dates were.
November and December were the least successful.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1000 to 4999 goal was the most successful.
45000 to 49999 goal was the least successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
You dont know what play.
You dont know what theater.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
You could have run what time of day the play was running.
You cold have run what the age group was for each play.
